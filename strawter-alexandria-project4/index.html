		<!-- General information-->
		<article id="gen">
			<h2 id="main">General Information</h2>
			<p id="intro">Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock
			formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint
			of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required
			and because accidents are more likely to happen on descent than ascent, Rock Climbers do not usually
			climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger
			multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional Rock climbing
			competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or
			attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity
			involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock
			climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight
			as well as to provide balance.</p>

			<p>Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Strength</li>
				<li>Endurance</li> 
				<li>Agility</li>
				<li>Balance</li> 
				<li>Mental Control</li>
			</ol> <p><strong>It can be a dangerous activity</strong>
			and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialised climbing equipment is crucial
			for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around
			the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines.</p>
		
		</article>
		<!-- Types -->
		<article id="info">	
		<h2 id="types">Types of Rock Climbing</h2>
			<p>Most of the climbing done in modern times is considered free climbing—climbing using
			one's own physical strength, with equipment used solely as protection and not as support—as opposed
			to aid climbing, the gear-dependent form of climbing that was dominant in the sport's earlier days.
			Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the
			choice of equipment used and the configurations of their belay, rope and anchor systems.</p>

			<p>As routes get higher off the ground, the increased risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates
			additional safety measures. A variety of specialized climbing techniques and climbing equipment
			exists to provide that safety. Climbers will usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and
			anchors designed to catch falls. Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many
			styles of climbing, and roped climbing is thus divided into further sub-types that vary based on how
			their belay systems are set up. Generally speaking, beginners will start with top roping and/or easy
			bouldering and work their way up to lead climbing and beyond.</p>

			<h3>Aid climbing</h3>
		 		<p>
				Still the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a wall by
				repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid ascent and enhance safety.</p>

			<h3>Free climbing</h3>
		 		<p>
				The most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical
				strength and skill are relied on to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may rely on top rope belay
				systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and
				protection are used to back up the climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids.
				Subtypes of free climbing are trad climbing and sport climbing. Free climbing is generally done as
				"clean lead" meaning no pitons or pins are used as protection.</p>

			<h3>Bouldering</h3>

				<p>
				Climbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most other
				styles. Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned bouldering pad below the route
				and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from
				hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting
				in exceptionally high difficulty standards.</p>

		 	<h3 id="galClear">Solo climbing</h3>
	
		 		<h4>Free soloing</h4>
		 			<p>
					Free soloing is single-person climbing without the use of any rope or protection system whatsoever.
					If a fall occurs and the climber is not over water (as in the case of deep water soloing), the
					climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured. Though technically similar to bouldering, free
					solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering.
					The term "highball" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and
					bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to
					cause serious injury (20 ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.</p>
				
		 		<h4>Roped solo climbing</h4>
		 			<p>
					Solo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to self-belay as
					they advance. Once the pitch is completed the soloist must descend the rope to retrieve their gear,
					and then reclimb the pitch. This form of climbing can be conducted free or as a form of aid
					climbing.</p>
					
				<h4>Deep-water soloing (DWS)</h4>
			
				<p><abbr title="Deep-water soloing">DWS</abbr> (or <em>psicobloc</em>) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is unprotected and
				without a rope, but should the climber falls, it is into deep water instead of onto the ground.</p>
					
			
		 	<h3>Lead climbing</h3>
		 		<p>
				Lead climbing is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through
				intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb.
				A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression
				without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and
				carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as
				nuts; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts.
				Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.</p>

		 		<p>Unlike top-rope climbing where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the
				climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will be attached to a point under him
				or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than
				that of top-rope and this is one of the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor
				is the ratio of the height a climbers falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The
				higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The
				maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing
				should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead
				climbing on their own.</p>

		 	<h3>Multi-pitch climbing</h3>
		 		<p>The climbing rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb the length of the rope. Routes
				longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as
				multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an
				anchor and then belays the second climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route
				taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the
				way in order to use them again on the next pitch. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the
				leader begins climbing the next pitch and so on until the top of the route is reached.</p>

		 		<p>In either case, upon completion of a route, climbers can walk back down if an alternate descent path
				exists, or rappel (abseil) down with the rope.</p>

		 	<h3>Sport climbing</h3>
				
		 		<p>Unlike traditional rock climbing, sport climbing involves the use of protection (bolts) or permanent
				anchors which are attached to the rock walls.</p>

		 	<h3>Traditional climbing</h3>
				
		 		<p>Traditional or trad climbing involves rock climbing routes in which protection against falls is
				placed by the climber while ascending. Gear is used to protect against falls but not to aid the
				ascent directly.</p>
			<!-- Two columns-->
		 	<h3>Bottom rope climbing and top rope climbing</h3>
				<div class="first">
					<h4>Bottom rope climbing</h4>
						<p>Commonly known as "Top Roping": belaying a climber from the ground or the base of the route. A belay
						system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created at the top of a climb, through which
						the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before
						starting the climb). The rope is "taken-in", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so
						in the event of a fall the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is
						normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the
						rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared
						to that of the belayer, among other things.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="second">
								<h4>Top rope climbing</h4>
									<p>Also known as "seconding," or belaying a climber from the top of a route, bringing them up to walk
									off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route, except the belayer
									has set the anchors at the top of the climb (normally after leading a route) to belay the climber
									either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vunlnerable when exposed to unexpected
									directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and
									belaying is done direct from the anchors using either an Italian / Munter Hitch or adapted use of a
									belay device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements
									have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.</p>

		<h2 id="techniques">Climbing Techniques</h2>
			<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Different types of rock require different techniques to successfully climb.</p>

			<h3>Crack climbing</h3>
				
				<p>Crack climbing is a type of rock climbing that ascends cracks and uses specialized climbing
				techniques. Cracks used in climbing vary in size from the width of a finger to those that fit an
				entire body. Climbers use techniques such as jamming, laybacking, and stemming. Some climbers use
				gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.</p>

			<h3>Face climbing</h3>
				
				<p>Face climbing is a type of climbing where climbers use features and irregularities in the rock such
				as finger pockets and edges to ascend a vertical rock face.</p>

			<h3>Slab climbing</h3>
				
				<p>Slab climbing is a type of rock climbing where the rock face is at an angle of less steep than
				vertical. It is characterized by balance- and friction-dependent moves on very small holds.</p>

			<h3>Simul climbing</h3>
				
				<p>When two climbers move at the same time. The pseudo-lead climber places gear that the
				pseudo-follower collects. When the leader runs low on gear they construct a belay station where the
				follower can join them to exchange gear. The stronger climber is often the pseudo-follower since a
				fall by the follower would pull the leader from below towards the last piece of gear—a potential
				devastating fall for the leader. In contrast, a fall from the leader would pull the follower from
				above, resulting in a less serious fall. Most speed ascents involve some form of simul climbing but
				may also include sections of standard free climbing and the use of placed gear for advancement (i.e.
				partial aid or pulling on gear).</p>

			<h3>Via ferrata</h3>
				
				<p>A method of fairly easily ascending a route, heavily dependent on permanent protection rather than
				using natural rock features to proceed.
