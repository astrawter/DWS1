		<h1>Rock climbing</h1>
		<p>Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock
formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint
of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Due to the length and extended endurance required
and because accidents are more likely to happen on descent than ascent, Rock Climbers do not usually
climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger
multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional Rock climbing
competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or
attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity
involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock
climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight
as well as to provide balance.

Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's
strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. It can be a dangerous activity
and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialised climbing equipment is crucial
for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around
the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines.</p>
		<h2>Types of Rock Climbing<h2>
		<p>Most of the climbing done in modern times is considered free climbing—climbing using
one's own physical strength, with equipment used solely as protection and not as support—as opposed
to aid climbing, the gear-dependent form of climbing that was dominant in the sport's earlier days.
Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the
choice of equipment used and the configurations of their belay, rope and anchor systems.

As routes get higher off the ground, the increased risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates
additional safety measures. A variety of specialized climbing techniques and climbing equipment
exists to provide that safety. Climbers will usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and
anchors designed to catch falls. Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many
styles of climbing, and roped climbing is thus divided into further sub-types that vary based on how
their belay systems are set up. Generally speaking, beginners will start with top roping and/or easy
bouldering and work their way up to lead climbing and beyond.

Aid climbing[edit]
Main article: Aid climbing
Still the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a wall by
repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid ascent and enhance safety.

Free climbing[edit]
Main article: Free climbing
The most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical
strength and skill are relied on to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may rely on top rope belay
systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and
protection are used to back up the climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids.
Subtypes of free climbing are trad climbing and sport climbing. Free climbing is generally done as
"clean lead" meaning no pitons or pins are used as protection.[7]

Bouldering[edit]

Main article: Bouldering
Climbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most other
styles. Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned bouldering pad below the route
and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from
hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting
in exceptionally high difficulty standards.

Solo climbing[edit]
Main article: Solo climbing
Deep-water soloing (DWS)[edit]
Main article: Deep-water soloing
Deep-water soloing (or psicobloc) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is unprotected and
without a rope, but should the climber falls, it is into deep water instead of onto the ground.

Free soloing[edit]
Main article: Free soloing
Free soloing is single-person climbing without the use of any rope or protection system whatsoever.
If a fall occurs and the climber is not over water (as in the case of deep water soloing), the
climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured. Though technically similar to bouldering, free
solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering.
The term "highball" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and
bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to
cause serious injury (20 ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.

Roped solo climbing[edit]
Main article: Roped solo climbing
Solo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to self-belay as
they advance. Once the pitch is completed the soloist must descend the rope to retrieve their gear,
and then reclimb the pitch. This form of climbing can be conducted free or as a form of aid
climbing.

Lead climbing[edit]
Main article: Lead climbing

Lead climbing is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through
intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb.
A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression
without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and
carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as
nuts; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts.
Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.

Unlike top-rope climbing where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the
climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will be attached to a point under him
or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than
that of top-rope and this is one of the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor
is the ratio of the height a climbers falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The
higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The
maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing
should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead
climbing on their own.

Multi-pitch climbing[edit]
The climbing rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb the length of the rope. Routes
longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as
multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an
anchor and then belays the second climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route
taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the
way in order to use them again on the next pitch. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the
leader begins climbing the next pitch and so on until the top of the route is reached.

In either case, upon completion of a route, climbers can walk back down if an alternate descent path
exists, or rappel (abseil) down with the rope.

Sport climbing[edit]
Main article: Sport climbing
Unlike traditional rock climbing, sport climbing involves the use of protection (bolts) or permanent
anchors which are attached to the rock walls.

Traditional climbing[edit]
Main article: Traditional climbing
Traditional or trad climbing involves rock climbing routes in which protection against falls is
placed by the climber while ascending. Gear is used to protect against falls but not to aid the
ascent directly.

Bottom rope climbing and top rope climbing

Top roping Balthazar (12), in the Morialta Conservation Park near Adelaide, South Australia. Top
roping is the most accessible style of climbing for beginners.

Bottom rope climbing
Commonly known as "Top Roping": belaying a climber from the ground or the base of the route. A belay
system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created at the top of a climb, through which
the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before
starting the climb). The rope is "taken-in", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so
in the event of a fall the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is
normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the
rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared
to that of the belayer, among other things.

Top rope climbing
Also known as "seconding," or belaying a climber from the top of a route, bringing them up to walk
off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route, except the belayer
has set the anchors at the top of the climb (normally after leading a route) to belay the climber
either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vunlnerable when exposed to unexpected
directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and
belaying is done direct from the anchors using either an Italian / Munter Hitch or adapted use of a
belay device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements
have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.</p>
