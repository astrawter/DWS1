		<h1>Electronic Sports</h1>
		<p>Electronic sports or Esports (also known as eSports, e-sports, competitive (video)
gaming, or progaming in Korea) is a term for
organized multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between
professional players. The most common video game genres associated with
electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person
shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Tournaments such as The
International Dota 2 Championships, the League of Legends World
Championship, the Battle.net World Championship Series, the Evolution
Championship Series, the Intel Extreme Masters, provide both live
broadcasts of the competition, and cash prizes to competitors.

Although organized online and offline competitions have long been a part
of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events
have seen a large surge in popularity from the late 2000s and early
2010s. While competitions around 2000 were largely between amateurs, the
proliferation of professional competitions and growing viewership now
supports a significant number of professional players and teams,[1] and
many video game developers now build features into their games designed
to facilitate such competition.

The genre of fighting games and arcade fighters have also been popular
in amateur tournaments, although the fighting game community has often
distanced themselves from the eSports label.[2] In 2012, the most
popular titles featured in professional competition were the multiplayer
online battle arena games Dota 2, League of Legends, and the real time
strategy game StarCraft II.[3] Shooting games like Counter Strike, Team
Fortress 2,and Call of Duty have enjoyed some success as eSports,
although their viewer numbers have remained below those of their
competitors.[4]

Geographically, eSports competitions have their roots in Germany (2015)
developed countries.[original research?] South Korea has the best
established eSports organizations, officially licensing pro-gamers since
the year 2000.[5] Official recognition of eSports competitions outside
South Korea has come somewhat slower. In 2013, Canadian League of
Legends player Danny "Shiphtur" Le became the first pro-gamer to receive
a United States P-1A visa, a category designated for "Internationally
Recognized Athletes".[6][7][undue weight? â€“ discuss] Along with South
Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and China.
Despite its large video game market, eSports in Japan is relatively
underdeveloped, which has been attributed largely to its broad
anti-gambling laws.[8] In 2014, the largest independent eSports brand,
Electronic Sports League, partnered with the local eSports brand Japan
Competitive Gaming to try and grow eSports in the country.[9]

In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 71,500,000 people worldwide
watched competitive gaming.[10] The increasing availability of online
streaming media platforms, particularly Twitch.tv, has become central to
the growth and promotion of eSports competitions.[11] Demographically,
Major League Gaming has reported viewership that is approximately 85%
male and 15% female, with 60% of viewers between the ages of 18 and
34.[12] Related this appreciable male majority, female gamers within the
industry are subject to significant sexism and negative stereotypes.[13]
Despite this, some women within eSports are hopeful about the general
progress in overcoming these problems.</p>
